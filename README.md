Q-Up Virtual Attraction Queueing Applicaiton - SETU Final Year Project

Q-Up is a virtual queuing system for attraction-based facilities that enables visitors to wait for an attraction in a 'virtual queue' rather than a physical queue. Using the app, a visitor can view details of attractions in a facility, with queue-time estimates. The user can enter a virtual queue for an attraction and enjoy other attractions while still in the queue for the first attraction.

When it is time is to enter the attraction, the user's current distance from it is taken into account, and the notification sent accordingly early. This system allows visitors to queue for the attractions they want to experience while still being able to enjoy the rest of the facility, and acts to redirect traffic to attractions with shorter queues, better distributing visitors throughout the facility.

The app allows the users to perform the following features:

- Enter a facility with a QR code
- View attractions on a map and list, and view more details about said attractions
- Join and leave queues at any time
- View queue status
- Receive notifications about queue updates
- Generate entrance tickets to enter into attractions once the user's queue time is short enough
